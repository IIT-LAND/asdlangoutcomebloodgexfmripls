# ASD Language Outcome Blood Leukocyte Gene Expression-fMRI PLS Analyses

Reproducible analysis reports from Lombardo et al., "Different large-scale blood leukocyte gene expression associations with functional neural systems in autism with poor early language outcome".

```all_reports.pdf``` has all steps of the analysis. These steps can be easily jumped to through the Table of Contents in the pdf document. Other MATLAB or R scripts that are sourced in the reports are within the repo as well.
